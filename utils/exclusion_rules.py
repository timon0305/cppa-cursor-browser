"""
Exclusion rules for filtering sensitive projects/chats.

Rule file: UTF-8 text. Lines starting with # or empty are ignored.
Each other line is one rule. If ANY rule matches the combined searchable text
(project title, chat title, model names, content), the item is excluded.

Rule syntax:
  - Terms separated by AND or OR (case-insensitive).
  - AND has higher precedence: "a OR b AND c" means (a) OR (b AND c).
  - Term = single word (substring match, case-insensitive) or "exact phrase" (exact phrase match).
  - One rule per line.

Example exclusion-rules.txt:
  # Exclude anything mentioning secret or internal
  secret OR internal
  "project alpha" AND confidential
  password

Note: Rules are loaded once at startup (or at the start of a CLI export run).
Changes to the exclusion rules file require an application restart (or re-running
the CLI export) to take effect.
